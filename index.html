						<p>This week's article is about travelling. I can't say I've been to many countries but I intend on doing so once I feel stable in my career and have a travel partner. I want to let the pictures do the talking of all the places I'd like to visit and why. </p>
						<p>I'll also be covering some of the activities I want to tick off my bucket list at some point in my life. Right now if I could, I would pack my bags and go for it - Around the world in 80 days?</p>
						
						<center><p><h3>My Places to Visit</h3></p></center>
						<h4> 1. Maldives</h4>
						<img src="img/Maldives.jpg" width=280px height=150px style="float:right;" alt="">
						I've met a lot of people that have said they've wanted to visit this place. I mean look at the stunning view, it looks like paradise. This would be a place I'd chill out and relax for a few days doing nothing at all. <p></p>
						
						<p><h4>2. Hong Kong</h4></p>
						<img src="img/Hong Kong.jpg" width=280px height=150px style="float:right;" text style = "float:left;" alt="">
						<p>Hong Kong is apparently known as a shopper's paradise which is one of the reasons I'd love to visit. But another is the festivals, culture and colourful nightlife. Imagine staying at a penthouse with that view --></p>
						
						<p><h4>3. Iceland</h4></p>
						<img src="img/Iceland.jpg" width=280px height=150px style="float:right;" text style = "float:left;" alt="">
						<p>This is my number one place to visit and one thing I really want to see. The northern lights (Aurora Borealis). There's tonnes of beaches and hot places I want to be right now but a place like this trumps all I think.</p>
						
						<p><h4>4. Singapore</h4></p>
						<img src="img/Singapore.jpg" width=280px height=150px style="float:right;" text style = "float:left;" alt="">
						<p>I remember the first picture of a rooftop pool someone showed me and it was in Singapore. Curiousity got the better of me and a quick google search got me very intrigued. A sky-high pool sounds heavenly. </p>
						
						<p><h4>5. Dubai</h4></p>
						<img src="img/Dubai.jpg" width=280px height=150px style="float:right;" text style = "float:left;" alt="">
						<p>I can't say Im very adventurous but sky-diving over the palm Jumeirah in Dubai is an obstacle I'd like to face at one point. I've come across many clips of other people doing so but I want to try for the thrill and adrenaline rush. </p>
