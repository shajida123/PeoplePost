						<p>Hello and welcome to my blog. </p>
						<p>For those of you who are not familiar with who I am, I am an apprentice at Accenture and have been for the past 1.5 years. I don't have much time on my hands to keep up to date on social networking sites but would like to leave a mark one way or another. This way, I thought I'd be able to watch my journey in Accenture and almost have an online diary - sharing no secrets or embarassing stories obviously.</p>
						
						<p>Just to give you a heads up, my posts will mainly be around my interests and right now, they mainly consist of cooking, eating out to try loads of foods and tonnes of pretty views I've witnessed.</p>

						<p>I'm a sucker for beautiful sunsets and sunrises and witnessed one of the best from London's highest.
						Bear in mind, this was around summer so sunsets peaked at around 9pm. My mates and I booked a trip to the top of the Shard for 8:30pm and arrived with enough time to watch the sunset at its best.</p>
						
						<p>I obviously took tonnes of photos - As you would! Hope you enjoy :)</p>
