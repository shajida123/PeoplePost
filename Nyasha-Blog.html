						<p>This is all about me blog. </p>
						<p>My name is Nyasha and I am 20 years old. Outside of work and education I enjoy Drama and theater and I am apart of a Drama group that I rehearse and learn with every Sunday. As a group we put on shows regularly and this is a great way to  show off our learned skills and entertain crowds of people. Along with Drama I also enjoy reading, writing and travelling. I plan to travel to every continent in the world to see what else the world has to offer outside of London. So far I have traveled to Africa, America and Europe.</p>

						<p>I am a software engineer apprentice with a yearsâ€™ experience in telephony and network engineering. 
							Upon joining Accenture, I worked on client site for ITV plc and here I had a number of roles and responsibilities that involved dealing with and managing clients and also learning several new technologies. </p>

						<p>I always ensured that I delivered and maintained a high standard of work and I also gained the ability to establish and maintain meaningful professional relationships. 
							Whilst working for Accenture and their clients, I am also working towards a degree in Software Engineering.</p>

						<p>This means my time-management and quick-learning skills are constantly being developed and improved. 
							I joined Accenture because of their world renowned reputation and I wanted to be a part of their successful brand through their apprenticeship scheme as I also love learning and I believe technology is one of the most exciting industries to be involved in.</p>
