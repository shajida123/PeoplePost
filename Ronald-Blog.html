						<p>Basketball is life blog. </p>
						<p>I have had many successes and disappointments in life, many loves that have come and gone, but the one true love that has stuck around has been the game of basketball. Basketball to me is life, it’s an escape, an art, a passion; but mostly its love.</p>
						<p>It is unlike any other sport, a true reflection of life.</p>
						<p>Like the 24 hours in each day, every possession in the game has 24 seconds, be it on offense or defences. I was first introduced to the game around the age of nine or 10, on the concrete court of Ladywell field’s park parking lot in Catford, south east London.</p>

						<p>In Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Lakers and the Celtics, the Celtics had led by as many as 16 points but with 12 seconds left were only up by two, 106-104.</p>

						<p>The Lakers came down and passed the ball inside to the leading scorer in NBA history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who was fouled on the shot and sent to the free throw line.</p>

						<p>Kareem made the first free throw but missed the second one.</p>

						<p>However, in the scramble for the rebound the ball was knocked out of bounds and given back to the Lakers.</p>

						<p>The Lakers called timeout and set up a play to throw the ball back inside to Kareem but instead Magic Johnson drove into the middle of the key and shot a perfect Kareem like hook shot over Boston’s Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish.</p>

						<p>The made shot gave the Lakers a 107-106 win and propelled them to go on and win the NBA Championship 4 games to 2.</p>

						<p>Magic Johnson, who shot what announcer Tommy Heinson called a “junior sky hook” was named Finals MVP.</p>
