						<p>About myself. </p>
						<P>My name is Mansor Shillingford, I’m 20 years old and an apprentice at Accenture today I want to talk bit about me and explain who I am exactly. </P>

						<P>I was born in March 14th 1996, which makes me pieces, and (random fact) my cousin in Jamaica was just elected as leader in Jamaica.
						Throughout this blog I thought I’d talk about the things most people wouldn’t know about me. </P>

						<P>I have a passion for innovation and technology that excites me and the other side of me is also passionate about gaining skills within technology, I’ve seen the amazing and cool things people have been able to create from my experience within the company so far but that is who I am today. You all would expect the normal tech savvy personality that an apprentice with Accenture would have but most of my life I had worked within media and throughout this blog I will talk about my past work in media and how that led me to perusing a life in tech. </P>

						<P>My Journey through media starts at around 8 years old in primary school, at the time I decided to become a better student in the school and correct some of my bad behavior… this meant to me that I should start dressing “smarter” so my cousin Malik and I came to school for the first time in blazers and smart shoes and as I looked across the playground I noticed another boy in my class who wore blazers too, for some reason being in a sort of “ghetto” school whilst dressing how I did made me feel proud of myself and to be honest the three of us young boys decided that we were the smartest and best looking guys in the school and started are own group called the Blazer Splitz Boyz. </P>

						<P>Long story short we ended up helping teachers and students in the school so much that by the end of the year we had our own segments within the head teacher’s assembly. Now we use to also help teachers in the younger years organize their class assemblies because we would teach them songs and dances to perform…but we ended up being asked by the head teacher to perform songs for specific school events such as graduations, teachers leaving, Diwali, Christmas and Eid. </P>

						<P>I decided then that I wanted to go to a stage school and get more involved in the arts and once I graduated from primary school (picture below): </P>

						<p>I travelled to America and stayed there for the summer holiday s before starting secondary school so that artist developers in music, dance and the general business of the industry could teach me.
